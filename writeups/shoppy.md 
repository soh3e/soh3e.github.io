Ok, we have ssh, http, and something called copycat? I've never seen this before...
Apparently it's a false positive: https://vato.cc/hackthebox-writeup-shoppy/

Although I did some directory bruteforcing with `gobuster`, it turns out I can also look for subdomains with `gobuster` as well! This is called **Vhost Discovery**.

`gobuster vhost -w ~/wordlists/vhosts/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -u shoppy.htb`

Like I said before, I did some directory bruteforcing and found `/login` and `/admin` which are both obviously pretty interesting. Both get me to the same page of `http://shoppy.htb/login`.

We get to a login page like so: https://imgur.com/a/x5EPyyw

Turns out the database running is MongoDB NoSQL 
*Basically always look for potential injections?!*
Like SQL injection as we just experienced here :) the things that will always return True...
In this case, `admin'||'1==1` always returns true for NoSQL.

Yay, we're in!
